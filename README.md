# MyProject
This project contains 3 codes about three different problems.
The first problem is about finding the nth occurrence of a word in a string.
The second problem is about Simple String Matching.
The last one is about telling whether the string is a palindrome or no.
I created two files one named string_ops.py and i wrote my codes in it, then i created another one called main.py to import the string_ops in it and called the functions written in the previous one in it.
I as well created an environment and downloaded the numpy and pandas which is present in the requirements.txt file.
